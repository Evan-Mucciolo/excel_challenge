WRITTEN REPORT
Given the provided data, what are three conclusions that we can draw about crowdfunding campaigns?
1.	Most of the crowdfunding campaigns are in theater.
2.	Journalism, technology, and photography have the highest success rate of all campaigns.
3.	The early summer months of June and July are the most successful months to launch a campaign.
What are some limitations of this dataset?
1.	The length of time the fund was open is not equal across all campaigns. This could contribute to inequalities in outcome as some people may be able to raise more money simply due to being open longer. 
2.	The currency is not all the same so it would be impossible to compare any dollar amounts between campaigns of different currency. 
What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create, and what additional value would they provide?
1.	Additional charts could be created to show the amount of money given to each category so we would have a better idea of what types of campaigns get the most money. This would have to be done to compare campaigns of the same currency. With this information people would know which type of campaigns get the most funding and then could have a better idea of which campaigns they should run themselves.
2.	Charts could be created to show the effect the spotlight and staff pick metrics have on the outcome of campaigns. The value provided here would show that a staff pick might heavily influence the success rate of a campaign and give fund raisers a better idea of where they should focus to ensure the success of their campaign. Itâ€™s possible that creating relationships with the staff and securing a staff pick would help their outcome the most.

STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
Use your data to determine whether the mean or median better summarizes the data.
1.	The median summarizes this data best for both the successful and unsuccessful campaigns. This is because the data is heavily skewed as the value of the mean is much larger than the median for both types of campaigns. This means that the data does not follow a normal distribution and ultimately the median is a better representation of central tendency. 
Use your data to determine if there is more variability with successful or unsuccessful campaigns. Does this make sense? Why or why not?
2.	There is more variability in successful campaigns than failed campaigns. This makes sense because the difference between the median and the mean is larger for the successful campaigns than the failed campaigns. In addition, the successful campaigns have a greater difference between the maximum and minimum values than the failed campaigns which indicates a greater spread in the data values.
